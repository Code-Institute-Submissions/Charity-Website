## UX
The aim of this website is to let users know of some of the problems that are happening around the world
and offer the option of accessing the some of the most popular charity organisation for people in need.
The target audience of this site are people, who are looking for good charity organisation and or want to have an
idea of some of the places in the world, in which people require help and why. Basic information of economic and political problems
are presented on the homepage with buttons included, that lead to the 'Donate' page, if a user wants to find a popular charity organisation
for a country in the list and another button, so one gets linked to the 'Statistics' page to compare data of countries in need.

The 'Map' web page has a map that was made with a Google Maps API. On the map, one can click on the markers, in order to get short and quick information
about specific countries and get linked to the 'Donate' page to find a charity organisation.

## Logic

## Style and Layout
-__Overall Style__-
The website should have four different web pages
The website should be as responsive as possible
I tried my best to use lots of semantic HTML5 elements, in order to have a good structure of the codes
SASS was utilized, in order to organise the CSS3 codes in a cleaner way and to have a better overview of them

-__Navigation__-
The website has a responsive navigation bar at the top, so that one can be linked to other web pages of the website

-__Aside buttons__-
Has buttons that lead to multiple social media pages
Has a calculator button on the 'Donate' page, which causes a draggable and fixed online calculator appear
Are unavailable on phone size

-__Footer__-
Gives contact information
Links a user the 'Contact', 'Map' and 'Statistics' pages
Shows social media buttons on phone screen sizes that link to social media pages
