##UX
The aim of this website is to let users know of some of the problems that are happening around the world
and offer the option of accessing the some of the most popular charity organisation for people in need.
The target audience of this site are people, who are looking for good charity organisation and or want to have an
idea of some of the places in the world, in which people require help and why. Basic information of economic and political problems
are presented on the homepage with buttons included, that lead to the 'Donate' page, if a user wants to find a popular charity organisation
for a country in the list and another button, so one gets linked to the 'Statistics' page to compare data of countries in need.

The 'Map' web page has a map that was made with a Google Maps API. On the map, one can click on the markers, in order to get short and quick information
about specific countries and get linked to the 'Donate' page to find a charity organisation.
